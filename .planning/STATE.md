## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Setup]: Next.js 14.2.x locked (not 15) — ISR semantics incompatible with Next 15
- [Setup]: Tailwind v3 locked (not v4) — prototype token system incompatible with v4 CSS-first @theme
- [Setup]: @supabase/ssr only — deprecated auth-helpers-nextjs is broken for App Router cookie management
- [Setup]: JWT admin claim must go in app_metadata (not user_metadata) — prevent client-side privilege escalation
- [Setup]: Client-direct upload to Supabase Storage via signed URLs — bypasses Vercel 4.5MB body limit

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 4]: Verify `createSignedUploadUrl` API signature against @supabase/supabase-js v2.49.x before building image uploads
- [Phase 3]: Decide age gate implementation: middleware redirect (better SEO) vs client-only cookie check (simpler) — resolve during Phase 3 planning
